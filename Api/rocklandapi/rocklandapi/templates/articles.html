            What Is a Rock? <br>
            To geologists, a rock is a natural substance composed of solid crystals of different minerals that have been fused together into a solid lump.
            
            The minerals may or may not have been formed at the same time. What matters is that natural processes glued them all together. <br><br>

            Types of Rocks <br>
            There are three basic types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
